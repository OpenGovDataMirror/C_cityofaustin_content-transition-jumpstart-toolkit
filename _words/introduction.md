## Get a Jumpstart on Transitioning your Content 

We are changing the way that we deliver digital services to residents. Hopefully, you’ve heard of the digital services project that is underway. If not, please [learn more about the project here](http://projects.austintexas.io/projects/austin-digital-services-discovery/about/what-we-are-doing/).

We’re helping departments transition their content to a prototype platform, ensuring that it is service-oriented, written and structured to meet the needs of residents.

We’re currently working with the project’s advisors and executives to develop the schedule for transitioning department services to the site and will let you know what that order will be.

In the meantime, we’ve developed a toolkit to help your department jumpstart the process and help you get ready to make the transition.

### Great! So How Can I Get Started?

Even if you’re not part of the early phase of site development, there are three things you can get started on now:
- understand and get comfortable with iterative development
- create profiles personas of your most frequent users
- conduct a thorough inventory of your current web content

Doing so will significantly shorten those steps once we’re ready to move you to the new site. These things do take some time, but we’ve found that they can provide great value not just for us, but for you as well.

They provide great insight for your broader marketing, communication and service delivery initiatives. So if you’re ready to get to work, we can help!
